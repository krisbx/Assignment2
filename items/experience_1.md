## Brantford Golf and Country Club

Worked as a Servers Assistant at the Club.

At the age of 15-16 during 9th grade.

Worked alongside my older sister, she was already good friends with most of the staff so it was easy to get to know them.

While we were setting up for a large event, we were able to taste test all of the food that would be presented.

Training was not optimal. I didnt get a chance to learn where items were stored, making my shifts a bit more difficult in the beginning.

The grade it gets is B.
