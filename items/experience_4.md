## Long Distance partner

Spent time together at my place.

Right now, and also the summer... and also earlier this year.

My weeks with them are always so much more lively than the rest.

We love to try something new every time they visit. Last time, we went to an claw machine arcade full of plushies.

The day they had to head home.

The grade I would give it is A.
