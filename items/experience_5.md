## Moving

We moved houses.

I believe it was August of 2013.

We moved into a much nicer and bigger home, in a better neighbourhood, and closer to our school.

Doing our first look around and seeing all of the new things we've never had before.

The moving process felt a bit sad, I still had a lot of attachment to our old home.

The grade I would give it is B.
