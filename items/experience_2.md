## Bakery

I worked in the bakery at Metro.

After COVID, I took a gap year between highschool and University to work.

The hours were nice. Only evening shifts and the tasks were pretty repetitive.

Decorating cakes was always fun. It wasn't technically <em>my</em> job, but I was allowed to help out.

There was construction going on inside the bakery, the loud noises were unbearable and they refused to give us any sort of construction-grade earplugs.

The grade I would give it is C.
