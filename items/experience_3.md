## Greece

Flew to Greece with my family.

Summer of 2024.

The views were amazing, and we visited both Athens and Naxos, so we got to see both sides of Greece.

There was a restaurant on the beach in Naxos, we had dinner as the sun set and the food and view were unforgettable.

Sometimes, the heat got insanely hot. Upwards of 40 degrees.

The grade I give it is B.
